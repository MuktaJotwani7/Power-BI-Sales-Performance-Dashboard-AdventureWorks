Designed an interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard to track revenue, profit, and customer trends. Built dynamic visuals with filters and drill-throughs for region, product, and time period, enabling clear insights into sales performance and business growth
The goal was to create a report that doesn’t just visualize numbers, but actually tells a story — answering real business questions like:

How are revenue and profit trending over time?

What products are driving the most sales or returns?

Who are the top customers based on purchase behavior?

How do income level and occupation affect sales?

Key Highlights of the Dashboard:

Dynamic KPIs: Revenue, Profit, Orders, Return Rate

Monthly performance breakdown with trend analysis

Product-level deep dive with drill-downs and filters

Customer segmentation by income level and occupation

Interactive features with slicers and category filters

Clean layout and report navigation for usability

This project gave me hands-on experience with:

Power Query for data cleaning and transformation

DAX for calculated metrics and comparisons

Designing intuitive, business-friendly visuals


It was a great learning experience that helped me improve both technically and analytically. I genuinely enjoyed the challenge of building something that combines logic, creativity, and storytelling through data.

Would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions!
